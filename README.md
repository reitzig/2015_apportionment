## Algorithms for Divisor Methods of Apportionment

This repository contains implementations of algorithms for proportional 
apportionment with divisor methods. Inspect and use at your own risk.

 * File
     [`SandwichSelect.java`](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/src/de/unikl/cs/agak/appportionment/algorithms/SandwichSelect.java)
   contains an implementation of the algorithm `SandwichSelect` we have presented in

   Some variants exist.

    [`ChengEppsteinSelect.java`](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/src/de/unikl/cs/agak/appportionment/algorithms/ChengEppsteinSelect.java)
   we provide an implementation of the algorithm proposed in

   in
     [`PukelsheimPQ.java`](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/src/de/unikl/cs/agak/appportionment/algorithms/PukelsheimPQ.java)
   with priority queues for determining the next party to modify, and in
     [`PukelsheimLS.java`](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/src/de/unikl/cs/agak/appportionment/algorithms/PukelsheimLS.java)
   using linear scan.

 * Finally, we give implementations of the naive iterative algorithms using
   priority queues resp. a linear scan for finding maxima in
     [`IterativeDMPQ.java`](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/src/de/unikl/cs/agak/appportionment/algorithms/IterativeDMPQ.java)
   and
     [`IterativeDMLS.java`](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/src/de/unikl/cs/agak/appportionment/algorithms/IterativeDMLS.java),
   respectively.

The core algorithms start in the respective implementations of method `unitSize` resp. `apportion`.

The remaining files provide interfaces, shared algorithmic parts and utility code.
Some files are taken or adapted from [Sedgewick/Wayne](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu)
with our thanks; we re-release their files in agreement with their 
license statement (see Q + A [here](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/)).

### Compilation

Execute `ant compile`; you will need [`algs4.jar`](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar)
(in folder `lib`) from the [book website of Sedgewick/Wayne](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).

### Usage

Run `ant test` for testing correctness of the implementations.
Besides rudimentary sanity checks, the test basically check Pukelsheim's 
Max-Min Inequality for *all* computed assignments, i.e. for all ways to resolve ties.

Command `ant run` executes a sample runtime experiment.

Run your own experiments by defining the parameters in a space-separated file
(see e.g. [arxiv2.experiment](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/arxiv3.experiment); those are the ones from the article)
and passing it as parameter to [`run_experiments.rb`](https://github.com/reitzig/2015_apportionment/blob/master/run_experiments.rb).
That is, 

    ruby run_experiments.rb arxiv.experiments 
    
runs the exact experiments used in [our article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06475).

In case you can not get this to work, here is a workaround.

 1. Open a terminal resp. command line in th repository and
 	execute `ant compile`.

 2. Create the following folder structure within the code respository:
 
        my_experiment
        |- data
        |- plots
        |   |- times
        |   |- counters
        |   |- scatter
        |   |- averages
        |- tmp
        
 3. Change directory to folder `my_experiment`.
 
 4. For each non-comment line from `arxiv.experiment` (or your file), execute
      
        java -cp ../build de.unikl.csgak.appportionment.experiments.RunningTimeMain [line]
        
    If you use `LDM(x,y)` as divisor method, enclose this parameter in double-quotes.
 
 5. Execute `gnuplot tmp/*.gp`.
 
*Hint:* For plotting purposes,
you can use script `separate_by_alg` to split the `.tab`-files in `data` by algorithm. 
If you need one file per input size, you can split *these* file using `separate_by_n`.
